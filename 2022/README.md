# Advent of Code 2022

Code puzzle implementations for the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022). To have more than just fun, I try to solve every puzzle in [Python](https://www.python.org), which is completely new to me.

You can run a puzzle by executing the following command in the specific folder:

```
python3 puzzle.py
```

If you want to run against the sample input, you can execute the following command:

```
python3 puzzle.py -sample
```

## Input Data

It's not allowed to share the input data. Therefore, you have to copy the input data from the website and add them to the folder of the specific day:

- Real input into `input.txt`
- Sample input into `sample.txt`
