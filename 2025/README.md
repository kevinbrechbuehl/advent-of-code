# Advent of Code 2025

Code puzzle implementations for the [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025). Again in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org). Starting this year, there will be [12 days](https://adventofcode.com/2025/about#faq_num_days) of puzzles each December.

As a prerequisite, you need to globally install `ts-node`:

```
npm install -g ts-node
```

You can run a puzzle by executing the following command in the specific folder:

```
ts-node puzzle.ts
```

If you want to run against the sample input, you can execute the following command:

```
ts-node puzzle.ts -- sample
```

## Input Data

It's not allowed to share the input data. Therefore, you have to copy the input data from the website and add them to the folder of the specific day:

- Real input into `input.txt`
- Sample input into `sample.txt`

Some puzzles have different sample data for part 1 and 2. For this puzzles, you need to put the data into `sample1.txt` and `sample2.txt`.
